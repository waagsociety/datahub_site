    Datahub is a New Way of Browing Data
    That You Need For Your Research
  text: >
    An API for the distribution and
    annotation of open data, for small
    cities and big metropolitan areas. With
    the CitySDK Linked Data API, a city has
    a simple-to-use interface to all its
    data â€” it makes city services easier
    to implement, data easier to distribute,
    and applications easier to build, and
    works for both real-time and static data
    sets.
